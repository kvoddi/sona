# Automated SCD Compliance Checking - Technical Reference

## Core Compliance Validation Framework

The SCD compliance validation system operates through a series of interconnected checks that evaluate change requests against predefined segregation of duties policies. Each change request triggers a compliance evaluation workflow that examines the requester identity, approver chain, implementation pathway, and temporal relationships between these elements.

The framework maintains a compliance rule engine that processes policies written in a domain-specific language designed for banking compliance requirements. These policies define who can approve what types of changes, what separation requirements exist between different roles, and what documentation or evidence is required to demonstrate compliance.

The system integrates with existing identity management systems to resolve user identities, role assignments, and organisational hierarchies. This integration ensures that compliance decisions are based on current, authoritative information about user permissions and responsibilities rather than static configuration files that might become outdated.

## Identity and Role Resolution

User identity resolution forms the foundation of all SCD compliance checking. The system needs to definitively establish who is requesting changes, who is approving them, and who is implementing them, even in highly automated environments where human involvement might be minimal.

For human actors, identity resolution involves integration with Active Directory, LDAP systems, or modern identity providers like Azure AD or Okta. The system maintains mappings between technical user accounts and business roles, ensuring that automated actions can be traced back to the human decision-makers who initiated them.

Service accounts and automation systems present additional complexity because they act on behalf of humans but execute independently. The compliance system maintains detailed lineage tracking that connects automated actions back to the human approvals that authorised them. This might involve parsing ServiceNow change records, Git commit histories, or deployment pipeline metadata to establish clear chains of accountability.

Role resolution goes beyond simple job titles to understand functional responsibilities within the change management process. A single person might hold multiple roles, but SCD requirements dictate which combinations of roles create conflicts of interest. The system maintains role relationship matrices that define which role combinations are permitted and which create compliance violations.

## Change Classification and Risk Assessment

The compliance checking system applies different validation rules based on change classification and risk levels. Standard changes that follow pre-approved patterns might only require basic role separation validation, whilst high-risk or emergency changes might require multiple levels of approval and additional documentation.

Change classification involves analysing the technical details of proposed changes against predefined categories. Infrastructure changes affecting production systems receive different treatment than development environment modifications. Database schema changes require different approval chains than configuration file updates. The system maintains detailed classification rules that can automatically categorise most change requests whilst flagging unusual changes for manual classification.

Risk assessment considers both the technical scope of changes and their potential business impact. The system evaluates changes against infrastructure topology maps, business service dependencies, and historical incident data to calculate risk scores. These risk scores determine which compliance policies apply and what level of segregation is required.

Cumulative risk assessment evaluates multiple changes together to identify situations where individually low-risk changes might collectively create higher risk levels. This might involve changes to related systems, changes within specific time windows, or changes that affect common infrastructure components.

## Temporal Compliance Validation

Many SCD requirements involve timing relationships between different activities. Changes should not be implemented until proper approvals are received. Certain approvals should not be granted until adequate review periods have elapsed. Emergency changes might have different timing requirements than standard changes.

The temporal validation engine maintains state information about change requests as they progress through approval and implementation workflows. It tracks when requests are submitted, when approvals are granted, when implementations begin, and when changes are completed. This timeline data is evaluated against policy rules that define required waiting periods, approval sequences, and implementation constraints.

For automated changes, temporal validation becomes more complex because multiple actions might occur in rapid succession. The system needs to understand which automated actions are immediate consequences of approvals and which represent independent decisions that require separate validation.

Emergency change procedures present particular temporal challenges because they often involve compressed timeframes and parallel approval processes. The compliance system maintains separate policy sets for emergency changes whilst ensuring that appropriate compensating controls are in place during expedited processes.

## Policy Engine Architecture

The policy engine processes compliance rules written in a structured format that can express complex segregation of duties requirements. These rules can reference user attributes, change characteristics, system properties, and temporal relationships to make compliance decisions.

Policy rules are organised hierarchically with general rules applying broadly and specific rules handling particular situations. This hierarchical structure allows for policy inheritance and overrides, enabling organisations to define common baseline requirements whilst accommodating specific regulatory or business requirements for different systems or change types.

The engine supports both positive and negative policy expressions. Positive rules define what is permitted under specific circumstances, whilst negative rules explicitly prohibit certain combinations of roles or actions. This dual approach provides flexibility in expressing complex compliance requirements.

Policy versioning and lifecycle management ensure that compliance rules can be updated over time whilst maintaining audit trails of when rules changed and why. Historical compliance evaluations remain valid even as policy rules evolve, provided the evaluations were correct under the rules in effect at the time.

## Integration with Change Management Systems

ServiceNow integration forms the primary interface between the compliance checking system and existing change management workflows. The system receives change request notifications via webhooks or API polling, extracts relevant information about requesters, approvers, and change details, and returns compliance assessment results.

The integration maintains bidirectional communication with ServiceNow, updating change records with compliance status information and blocking or allowing change progression based on compliance results. This ensures that non-compliant changes cannot proceed through automated workflows whilst providing clear feedback about compliance violations.

GitLab and other CI/CD systems require different integration approaches because they operate on code repositories rather than formal change requests. The compliance system can analyse Git commit metadata, merge request approval chains, and deployment pipeline configurations to assess compliance for code-based changes.

Integration with monitoring and alerting systems enables real-time compliance violation detection. When changes are implemented outside of approved change management processes, the compliance system can detect these unauthorised changes and initiate appropriate response procedures.

## Compliance Validation Methods

Technical validation methods vary depending on the systems and processes being evaluated. For infrastructure as code deployments, the system can analyse Terraform plans or Ansible playbooks to understand what changes will be implemented and verify that appropriate approvals exist for those specific changes.

Database change validation involves analysing SQL scripts or migration files to identify schema modifications, data changes, or permission updates. The system maintains libraries of change patterns that require specific approval levels or segregation requirements.

Application deployment validation examines deployment artifacts, configuration changes, and infrastructure modifications associated with application releases. This might involve parsing container images, configuration files, or deployment manifests to identify all components of a release package.

Configuration management validation checks changes made through tools like Chef, Puppet, or Ansible. The system can evaluate configuration cookbooks or playbooks against compliance policies and verify that configuration changes follow appropriate approval workflows.

## Audit Trail Generation

Comprehensive audit trail generation captures all aspects of compliance checking activities for regulatory examination and internal review. These audit trails include not just compliance decisions but also the data and reasoning behind those decisions.

Each compliance check generates detailed logging information that includes the policies evaluated, the data sources consulted, the decision logic applied, and the final compliance determination. This information is structured to support both automated analysis and human review during audit processes.

Audit trails maintain immutable records of compliance decisions even as systems and policies evolve over time. This ensures that historical compliance assessments remain available for regulatory review and can be validated against the policies and data that were current at the time of the decisions.

The audit system supports various output formats required by different regulatory frameworks and audit processes. This might include standardised compliance reports, detailed technical logs, or summary dashboards that provide oversight into compliance trends and violation patterns.

## Exception Handling and Escalation

Exception handling procedures address situations where standard compliance checking cannot determine appropriate actions or where legitimate business needs require deviations from standard policies. These procedures maintain audit trails whilst providing necessary flexibility for complex business environments.

Automated exception detection identifies changes that cannot be evaluated by standard compliance rules and routes them for manual review. This might involve changes to systems not covered by current policies, changes that involve external parties or systems, or changes that combine multiple elements in unusual ways.

Manual override procedures allow authorised personnel to approve changes that would otherwise fail compliance checks, provided appropriate justification and compensating controls are documented. These overrides are subject to additional approval requirements and enhanced monitoring to ensure they are not abused.

Escalation workflows ensure that compliance violations are promptly addressed by appropriate personnel. Different violation types might require different escalation paths, from simple notifications for minor policy deviations to immediate incident response procedures for serious segregation of duties breaches.

## Performance and Scalability

The compliance checking system is designed to operate at enterprise scale without impacting change management performance. Compliance evaluations are typically completed within seconds for standard changes, ensuring that automated workflows can proceed without noticeable delays.

Caching mechanisms store frequently accessed policy rules, user identity information, and system configuration data to minimise response times. The caching system includes appropriate invalidation logic to ensure that cached data remains current as underlying systems change.

Horizontal scaling capabilities allow the compliance system to handle varying workloads as change volumes fluctuate. This might involve processing hundreds of changes during major deployment windows or maintaining steady state operations during normal business periods.

Performance monitoring and alerting ensure that compliance checking does not become a bottleneck in change management processes. The system provides metrics about evaluation times, throughput rates, and resource utilisation to support capacity planning and performance optimisation efforts.

## Reporting and Analytics

Compliance reporting capabilities support both operational oversight and regulatory examination requirements. Standard reports provide summaries of compliance status, violation trends, and policy effectiveness across different time periods and organisational units.

Advanced analytics capabilities identify patterns in compliance data that might indicate process improvements, policy gaps, or training needs. This might include analysis of common violation types, identification of users or systems with unusual compliance patterns, or evaluation of policy rule effectiveness.

Executive dashboards provide high-level visibility into compliance status and trends for management oversight. These dashboards highlight key metrics like compliance rates, violation frequencies, and remediation times whilst drilling down into specific problem areas when needed.

Regulatory reporting features generate standardised compliance reports required by banking regulators and auditors. These reports can be customised to meet specific regulatory requirements whilst maintaining consistency with internal compliance metrics and analysis.
