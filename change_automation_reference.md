## Automation Pattern Specifications

### Pattern 1: Automated Change Request Creation

- Scheduled maintenance events (cron jobs, calendar systems)
- Policy compliance violations (configuration management tools)

**Required APIs:**
- ServiceNow Table API for change request creation
- ServiceNow Import Set API for bulk request processing
- ServiceNow Attachment API for supporting documentation

**Data Requirements:**
- Change classification (standard, normal, emergency)
- Risk assessment (low, medium, high)
- Implementation details (systems affected, procedures)
- Rollback procedures (automated or manual steps)

**Template Categories:**
- Security patch deployments
- Infrastructure capacity changes
- Configuration updates
- Compliance remediation

### Pattern 2: Automated Implementation Execution

**Orchestration Tools:**
- **Ansible Tower/AWX**: Playbook execution and workflow management
- **Terraform Enterprise**: Infrastructure as Code deployments
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipeline orchestration
- **GitLab CI/CD**: Git-based deployment workflows

**Credential Management:**
- HashiCorp Vault integration for secrets
- CyberArk PAM integration for privileged accounts
- ServiceNow credential store for automation accounts
- Key rotation and lifecycle management

**Execution Environments:**
- Containerised execution (Docker, Podman)
- Virtual machine-based execution
- Cloud-native execution (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
- Hybrid cloud orchestration

**State Management:**
- Terraform state backends (S3, Azure Storage)
- Ansible fact caching and state tracking
- Configuration management databases (CMDBs)
- Version control for infrastructure definitions

### Pattern 3: Automated Validation and Testing

**Health Check Categories:**
- **Service Health**: Application availability, response times, error rates
- **Infrastructure Health**: CPU, memory, disk, network metrics
- **Integration Health**: Database connections, API endpoints, message queues
- **Business Health**: End-to-end transaction validation, synthetic monitoring

**Compliance Testing:**
- **Security Controls**: Access permissions, encryption, vulnerability scans
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Data protection, audit logging, segregation of duties
- **Policy Adherence**: Configuration baselines, approved software versions
- **Change Controls**: Approval workflows, documentation requirements

**Testing Frameworks:**
- InSpec for infrastructure compliance testing
- Testinfra for system state validation
- Postman/Newman for API testing
- Selenium for web application testing

**Validation Thresholds:**
- Performance degradation limits (response time increases >20%)
- Error rate thresholds (error rates >2%)
- Availability requirements (uptime >99.9%)
- Compliance score minimums (100% for critical controls)

### Pattern 4: Automated Rollback Execution

**Rollback Triggers:**
- Health check failures exceeding thresholds
- Compliance validation failures
- Manual rollback requests from operations teams
- Time-based triggers (validation timeout)

**Rollback Methods:**
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform plan reversion, CloudFormation stack rollback
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible playbook reversal, Chef cookbook reversion
- **Application Deployment**: Blue-green deployment switches, canary rollbacks
- **Database Changes**: Transaction rollbacks, schema migration reversals

**State Preservation:**
- Pre-change snapshots (VM snapshots, database backups)
- Configuration backups (file system, database configurations)
- Application state preservation (session data, transaction logs)
- Infrastructure state documentation (network configurations, security groups)

**Rollback Validation:**
- Same health checks as forward validation
- Restoration verification (data integrity, service availability)
- Performance baseline confirmation
- Compliance status re-verification
