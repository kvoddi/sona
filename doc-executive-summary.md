# Documentation Strategy Executive Summary

## The Challenge
Platform Engineering manages critical infrastructure platforms (VMware, OpenShift, HashiCorp Vault, etc.) but lacks standardized documentation practices. This leads to:
- Inconsistent documentation quality
- Difficulty finding information
- Duplicate and outdated content
- Unclear ownership and maintenance

## The Solution
A comprehensive documentation strategy based on three pillars:

### 1. Standardized Framework (Diátaxis)
- **Four clear documentation types**: Tutorials, How-To Guides, Reference, Explanation
- **Each serves a specific purpose**: Learning, Doing, Looking up, Understanding
- **No debates** - we've chosen a framework and will follow it consistently

### 2. Governance Model
- **Clear ownership**: Every document has an owner
- **Regular reviews**: Quarterly reviews, trigger-based updates
- **Metrics-driven**: Track usage, quality, and impact
- **Defined lifecycle**: Plan → Draft → Review → Publish → Maintain → Retire

### 3. Platform Guidelines
- **Docusaurus**: Technical platform documentation
- **Confluence**: Team collaboration and drafts
- **GitLab**: Code-adjacent documentation
- **SharePoint**: Corporate documents
- **Policy Hub**: Compliance and governance

## Key Benefits
- **For Developers**: Find answers quickly, self-service support
- **For Platform Teams**: Reduced support tickets, knowledge preservation
- **For Organization**: Faster onboarding, compliance readiness, reduced operational risk

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
- Adopt Diátaxis framework
- Establish governance model
- Set up Docusaurus
- Train documentation owners

### Phase 2: Migration (Months 3-4)
- Audit existing documentation
- Categorize into Diátaxis quadrants
- Migrate from Confluence to Docusaurus
- Establish metrics baseline

### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 5-6)
- Refine based on metrics
- Automate quality checks
- Expand coverage
- Continuous improvement

## Success Metrics
- **90%** platform features documented
- **30%** reduction in support tickets
- **< 2 minutes** average time to find information
- **4/5** user satisfaction score

## Investment Required
- **Time**: 20% of sprint capacity for documentation debt
- **Tools**: Docusaurus hosting, automation tools
- **Training**: Diátaxis framework training for teams

## Call to Action
1. **Approve** documentation standards
2. **Assign** platform documentation owners
3. **Allocate** time for documentation in sprints
4. **Begin** migration to Docusaurus

## Quick Wins
- Start new documentation in Docusaurus immediately
- Apply Diátaxis to one platform as pilot
- Create documentation index in Confluence
- Establish #documentation Slack channel
