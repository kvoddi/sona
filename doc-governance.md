# Documentation Governance and Maintenance Model

## Purpose

This document establishes the governance structure, maintenance processes, and operational model for infrastructure platform documentation. It ensures documentation remains accurate, relevant, and valuable throughout its lifecycle.

## Documentation Lifecycle

### Overview

Every piece of documentation follows a defined lifecycle from inception to retirement. This ensures documentation remains current, accurate, and relevant.

### Lifecycle Stages

1. **Plan**
   - Identify documentation gaps through user feedback, support tickets, or new features
   - Determine the appropriate Di치taxis quadrant
   - Assign ownership and set timeline
   - Define success criteria

2. **Draft**
   - Write according to the appropriate Di치taxis quadrant
   - Follow established best practices
   - Include all required metadata (owner, version, date)
   - Complete internal self-review

3. **Review**
   - Peer review by subject matter expert
   - Technical accuracy verification
   - Alignment with Di치taxis framework
   - Accessibility and clarity check

4. **Publish**
   - Deploy to documentation platform
   - Update navigation and indexes
   - Announce to relevant stakeholders
   - Monitor initial feedback

5. **Maintain**
   - Regular review cycles
   - Update based on platform changes
   - Incorporate user feedback
   - Fix reported issues

6. **Retire**
   - Archive deprecated documentation
   - Redirect to updated resources
   - Maintain for historical reference if required
   - Update all references and links

## Roles and Responsibilities
